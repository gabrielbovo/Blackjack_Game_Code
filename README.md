# Blackjack_Game_Code
This is a simple Blackjack Game (without split cards option) that I've made when I was taking " 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021" made by Dr. Angela Yu. This course is available on Udemy.  This exercise is intended to be a basic level, so this is a little bit far from a real online Blackjack Game.
