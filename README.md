# Blackjack_Game_Code

Hello, I'm Gabriel Bovo.

This is a simple Blackjack Game (without split cards option) that I wrote when I was taking the "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021" course with Dr. Angela Yu, available on Udemy.
Angela Yu proposed this exercise to Beginners, so this is incomparable with a real online Blackjack Game.

I share with you my own resolution for this exercise, and, different of what Angela proposed, I made the game with the intuition of two players playing, not just 1 user against the computer.

The project is basically the full game. If you copy and paste it into Pycharm, and run the code, the game will start.

I tried to explain each part of the code, I hope it is undestandable. I will be very grateful if you share any suggestions, comments, or anything that might add to my learning. And if you had a problem understanding my code, or something else, I'll try to help you as soon as possible.

Thanks in advance, Have Fun! Gabriel Bovo.
