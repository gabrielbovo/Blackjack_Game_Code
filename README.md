# Blackjack_Game_Code

Hello, I'm Gabriel Bovo.

This is a simple Blackjack Game (without split cards option) that I did when I was taking " 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021" made by Dr. Angela Yu, available on Udemy.  
Angela Yu proposed this exercise in "Day 11 - Beginner - The Blackjack Capstone Project"
This exercise is intended to be a Beginner Project, so this is a little bit far from a real online Blackjack Game.

I'm sharing with you my own resolution for this exercise, and, different than Angela proposed, I made the game with the intuition of two players playing, not just 1 user against the computer.

The project is basically the full game. If you copy and paste it into Pycharm, and run the code, the game will start.

I tried to explain each part of the code, I hope it is undestandable. 
I will be very grateful if you share any suggestions, comments, or anything that might add to my learning.
And if you had a problem understanding my code, or something else, I'll try to help you as soon as possible.

Thanks in advance,
Have Fun!
Gabriel Bovo.
